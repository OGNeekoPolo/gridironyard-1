# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# @players = File.read("lib/players.json")
# json = JSON.parse(@players)
# json.each do |player|
#   Player.create(
#     nfl_id: player['id'],
#     name: player['name']
#   )
# end
#
# @all_players = Player.all
# @all_players.each do |player|
#   PlayerStat.create(
#     player_id: player.id
#   )
# end
